# Workforce Intelligence Platform (Microsoft Fabric)
### XDT AI — XavierDataTech  
End‑to‑end HR & Workforce Analytics Architecture

This project is part of the XDT AI initiative to build modern, scalable, and audit‑ready analytics solutions for HR, Workforce, and Compliance environments.  
It demonstrates how Microsoft Fabric can be used to unify ingestion, transformation, semantic modeling, and reporting into a single, governed platform.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Workforce Intelligence Platform** provides a modular architecture for analyzing:

- Headcount & FTE evolution  
- Absenteeism & leave patterns  
- Turnover & retention  
- Labor cost modeling  
- Productivity & workforce planning  
- PRL / OHS compliance metrics  

The goal is to offer a **reusable, cloud‑native framework** that organizations can adapt to their own HR data landscape.

## 🧱 Architecture
The solution is structured around Microsoft Fabric’s unified analytics stack:

### **1. Ingestion Layer**
- Dataflows Gen2  
- Pipelines for scheduled ingestion  
- Source examples: HRIS, payroll, time & attendance, OHS systems  

### **2. Lakehouse / Medallion Model**
- **Bronze:** Raw HR data  
- **Silver:** Cleaned, standardized tables  
- **Gold:** Business-ready HR analytics entities  

### **3. Semantic Model**
- Power BI semantic model with HR-specific measures  
- DAX patterns for workforce KPIs  
- Role-level security (RLS) for sensitive HR data  

### **4. Reporting Layer**
- Executive dashboards  
- Workforce trends  
- Absenteeism & turnover insights
